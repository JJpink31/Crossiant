      <h1>Croissant</h1>
      <p>
        A French crescent-shaped roll made of sweet flaky pastry, often eaten
        for breakfast.

      <h2>Did you know?</h2>

        The croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the moment
        people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French
        innovation,” says Chevallier. “It has fully taken root in its adopted
        land.” Order a kipfel in Austria or Germany today and you'll likely be
        handed a crescent-shaped cookie.
