    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A French crescent-shaped roll made of sweet flaky pastry, often eaten for
      breakfast.

      The croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the moment
      people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation,”
      says Chevallier. “It has fully taken root in its adopted land.” Order a
      kipfel in Austria or Germany today and you'll likely be handed a
      crescent-shaped cookie.
